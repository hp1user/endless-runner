# Daily Work Report

Use this document to track daily progress, features implemented, and bugs fixed.

## Date: 2026-09-03

### Features Added
- **Boss Camera Transition**: Created `BossCameraController.cs` to smoothly toggle between standard and back-facing Cinemachine Virtual Cameras during the boss phase.
- **Project Architecture Documentation**: Compiled `ProjectArchitecture.md` as a living technical document outlining the codebase.
- **Daily Work Report**: Created this tracking document.

### Bugs Fixed & Improvements
- **Boss Spawn Timing**: Added a 2-second delay to `EnemyManager.SpawnBoss` to allow the camera and transition bridge to set up gracefully before the boss arrives.
- **Boss Defeat Logic**: Fixed a bug in `EnemyController.cs` where the boss would not properly end the phase upon dying. Implemented an `isBoss` flag to correctly invoke `GameManager.BossDefeated()`.
- **Boss Frequency Reverted**: Re-assigned `levelsBetweenBosses = 10` in `GameManager.cs` to restore standard gameplay pacing.

### Features Added
- **Boss Multi-Part Health System (1000 HP)**:
  - Created `BossBodyPart.cs` component for localized damage zones on the boss.
  - Divided total Boss health (1000 HP) across 3 parts: Head (600 HP), Left Leg (200 HP), and Right Leg (200 HP).
  - Updated `Bug Boss.prefab` and `EnemyDatabase.asset` to support the new combined health model.
- **Non-Lethal Leg Crippling & Half-Speed Chase**:
  - Boss no longer dies when both legs break.
  - Breaking both legs reduces movement speed to 50% (`moveSpeed * 0.5f`) while the boss continues to chase the player in a heavy crippled crawl locomotion (`Vertical = 2, Horizontal = 0`).
- **Boss Relentless Chase & Instakill**:
  - Removed artificial stopping distance in `EnemyController.cs`; boss chases the player indefinitely.
  - Boss reaching the player immediately calls `PlayerController.Kill()` to trigger Game Over.
- **Inverted Boss Fight Controls**:
  - Inverted lane swiping in `PlayerController.cs` while `isBossFightActive` is true to match the 180° flipped camera perspective.
- **Configurable Ultimate Damage**:
  - Added `damage` (500) and `bossDamage` (250) fields to `SkillData.cs` and `AOE.asset`.
  - Updated `PlayerController.ActivateUltimate()` so the Ultimate deals balanced damage against bosses instead of instant-killing with 9999 damage.
  - Added multi-collider deduplication (`HashSet<EnemyController>`) preventing the boss from being hit multiple times in a single activation.
- **Boss Checkpoint & Quick Battle Testing System**:
  - Created `BossCheckpointSystem.cs` to allow instant jumps to any boss level (Level 5, Level 10, etc.) without clearing wave stages.
  - Automatically simulates progression by awarding random upgrade cards (e.g. 5 cards for Level 5, 10 for Level 10) via `UpgradeManager.ApplyRandomUpgrades()`.
  - Automatically unlocks tier-appropriate weapons with ammo (Shotgun & SMG for Level 5; Assault Rifle, LMG, and Sniper for Level 10).
  - Cleans up active wave enemies via `EnemyManager.ClearAllActiveEnemies()` and immediately initiates the boss battle.
  - Added Inspector Context Menu actions (`Jump to Boss (Level 5)`, `Jump to Boss (Level 10)`) and an auto-start toggle on `GameManager.cs`.

### Bugs Fixed & Improvements
- **Broken Leg Damage Block**: Fixed a bug where `BossBodyPart.cs` returned `0f` damage once a leg was broken. Broken parts now continue passing full damage to the boss's total 1000 HP pool until the boss is defeated.
- **Premature Cripple Animation**: Fixed a bug where the cripple animation was playing on the first bullet hit while legs still had ~200 HP remaining. The boss now walks normally until a leg's durability reaches 0.
- **Cripple Animation Inversion**: Fixed an orientation mismatch in `EnemyController.cs` so shooting the Right Leg triggers Right Leg Cripple (`Horizontal = -1`), and Left Leg triggers Left Leg Cripple (`Horizontal = 1`).
- **UI Toolkit Verification**: Verified the `DataManagerWindow` editor tool is implemented with modern UI Toolkit (`CreateGUI`, UXML, USS, `TwoPaneSplitView`, and `InspectorElement` bindings).
